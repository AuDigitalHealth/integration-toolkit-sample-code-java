--------
* updated nehta-smi-xsp-1.2.0.jar - this includes a refactored CertificateVerifier, 
  renamed to CertificateValidator the older CertificateVerifier will continue to work if used from
  nehta-vendorlibrary-java-common-1.1.0.
  
* updated nehta-vendorlibrary-java-common-1.1.0 to accommodate changes in xsp and new CertificareValidator
* changed the default CertificareValidator from the Null impl to one that does basic validations, time and trust
* HISecurity Handler no longer assigns it's own xml:id to signed elements, this is left to xsp-api now.
  as a result, xml:id's are no longer prefixed with 'ts_' 'data_' etc.   
  
+ Clients now accept an optional CertificateValidator that will be applied by the HI security handler when processing
  signed SOAP responses,  if a null validator is supplied the client will still check the validity dates of the 
  certificate used to sign the response SOAP message.
