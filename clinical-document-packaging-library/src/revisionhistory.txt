1.2.4 - not yet deployed
-----
* fix PackagingUtility.java removing ')' for the split char for a directory name


1.2.3
---------
* updated XmlSignedPayload library (nehta-smi-xsp) and related jar nehta-vendorlibrary-java-common
* updated PackagingUtility to take CertificateValidator
* updated PackagingUtility to force close zip after unpackaging in extractZipEntries()


1.2.2
---------
* updated to latest eSignature library (1.1) for eSignature signingTime bug.


1.2.1
---------
+ Added attachment verification. This ensures that the if CDA document integrity 
  checks exist, associated packaged attachment file content passes verification, 
  if those files are present.
* Fix to extracting attachment URI value when nested in directories.

1.2.0
---------
* Relaxed package extraction constraints to allow for directory names other than
  'IHE_XDM' and 'SUBSET01'.
* Modification to generated package names to prevent conflicts with PCEHR generated
  code for digital signatures.

1.1.1
---------
* Packages consist of a discrete ZIP entry for all directories in the
  ZIP hierarchy. For example, adding the following file:

    - ./IHE_XDM/SUBSET01/CDA_ROOT.XML

  This will produce the following ZIP entries:

    - IHE_XDM/
    - IHE_XDM/SUBSET01/
    - IHE_XDM/SUBSET01/CDA_ROOT.XML

  Package creation functionality now reflects this.

1.1.0
---------
* Modified root document hash comparison to accommodate for generated
  code inclusion.
* Exposed the ability to provide a custom CertificateVerifier to verify
  the packages signed payload signature.
* Introduction of more informative exceptions encountered during
  package extraction.

1.0.0
---------
+ Initial Version
+ Support for base CDA package profile.
