0.7.0 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.

Known Limitations:
! Allowable client properties are dependent on the JAX-WS implementation in use. The vendor libraries provided are compiled against the JAX-WS
  reference implementation provided with Java 6. Should you require a different version or be using the endorsed standards override mechanism, the
  PCEHR client libraries and properties will need to be updated and re-compiled accordingly.

Change History:
+ Added new view type GetObservationalView
- Removed getConstolidatedView



0.6.9 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.

Known Limitations:
! Allowable client properties are dependent on the JAX-WS implementation in use. The vendor libraries provided are compiled against the JAX-WS
  reference implementation provided with Java 6. Should you require a different version or be using the endorsed standards override mechanism, the
  PCEHR client libraries and properties will need to be updated and re-compiled accordingly.

Change History:
+ Added new format codes for PCEHR Prescription Record and PCEHR Dispense Record.
+ Added "authorSpecialty" into XDS metadata for both UploadDocumentClient and UploadDocumentMetadataClient.
* Updated class code for ePrescription and Dispense Record.





0.6.8 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.

Known Limitations:
! Allowable client properties are dependent on the JAX-WS implementation in use. The vendor libraries provided are compiled against the JAX-WS
  reference implementation provided with Java 6. Should you require a different version or be using the endorsed standards override mechanism, the
  PCEHR client libraries and properties will need to be updated and re-compiled accordingly.

Change History:
+ Updated to reflect changes in PCEHR WSDLs. New sample clients for getRepresentativeList,  getIndividualDetailsView, and getView web services.


0.6.7 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.

Known Limitations:
! Allowable client properties are dependent on the JAX-WS implementation in use. The vendor libraries provided are compiled against the JAX-WS
  reference implementation provided with Java 6. Should you require a different version or be using the endorsed standards override mechanism, the
  PCEHR client libraries and properties will need to be updated and re-compiled accordingly.

Change History:
* Updated MetadataUtils.toDocumentMetadata() to allow for PAI-D and LocalSystemIdentifier XCN Author IDs 


0.6.6 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.

Known Limitations:
! Allowable client properties are dependent on the JAX-WS implementation in use. The vendor libraries provided are compiled against the JAX-WS
  reference implementation provided with Java 6. Should you require a different version or be using the endorsed standards override mechanism, the
  PCEHR client libraries and properties will need to be updated and re-compiled accordingly.

Change History:
+ Enhancement to allow client properties to be set using 'setProperty' method. For instance:
    DoesPCEHRExistClient client = ... // constructor call
    client.setProperty(JAXWSProperties.CONNECT_TIMEOUT, 180000); // Timeout of three minutes.
* Abstraction of client code to improve manageability.
+ Accessor method for 'Client' port.

0.6.5 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.

Known Limitations:
+ 'GetDocument' SOAP response from SVT does not comply with DEXS-T 109 of the PCEHR Document Exchange Service Technical Service Specification. This is
  in the process of being corrected.
+ 'UploadDocument' SOAP request is being incorrectly rejected by the SVT as having an invalid signature. This is in the process of being corrected.

Change History:
+ Added new 'MTOMHandler.java' SOAPHandler to address JAX-WS limitations. This applies to 'UploadDocument'. Without this additional functionality,
  the request is limited to a single SOAP envelope that contains the Base64-encoded document, inline. This is due to SOAPHandlers forcing the content
  back into the original SOAP envelope. The new handler manually splits out the content into a new MTOM MIME part and injects an XOP reference to that
  new part in the SOAP envelope, in place of the old Base64 text.
+ Added 'MTOMHandler' to client handler chain.
+ Split out common handler functionality into new 'HandlerUtils.java'.
+ Added a new namespace for XOP in 'XMLNamespaces.java'.
* Updated 'SecurityHandler.java' to make use of the common methods in 'HandlerUtils.java'.
- Removed skipping of the 'GetDocument' operation response verification check in 'SecurityHandler.java' (see version 0.6.4 release notes for further
  detail).

0.6.4 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.

Known Limitations:
+ 'GetDocument' SOAP response from SVT does not comply with DEXS-T 109 of the PCEHR Document Exchange Service Technical Service Specification.

Change History:
+ Added new enum value to 'DocumentStatus' => 'urn:ordreq:names:statusType:Deleted', as documented in the PCEHR Implementation Guide.

0.6.3 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.

Known Limitations:
+ 'GetDocument' SOAP response from SVT does not comply with DEXS-T 109 of the PCEHR Document Exchange Service Technical Service Specification.

Change History:
+ New 'SecurityHandler' code to partially skip validation of the GetDocument SOAP response. This code is as follows:

    /** Start DEXS-T 109 Ignore **/
    if (isGetDocumentResponse(context)) {
    return;
    }
    /** End DEXS-T 109 Ignore **/

  If this functionality is undesired, remove/comment out the above lines. Signature verification will then fail for that response, with the handling
  of the exception and response left to the vendor.

0.6.2 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.

Pre-Requisites:
+ SVT 5.11 (or greater) environment required for support of:
  1) CDA document <id> root value of type UUID in document uploads.
  2) Signature verification
  3) 'GetRepresentativeList' and 'RegisterPCEHR' clients.

Change History:
* Fix for 'UploadDocument' submission set metadata association for document replacement.
* Fix metadata value mismatch for 'XDSDocumentEntry.typeCodeDisplayName'.
* Updated 'FormatCodes' values to reflect current environment values. 'CodedValue' types can be passed
  to the 'UploadDocument*' clients in the event that the 'FormatCodes' are insufficient or incorrect.
* Fix to 'UploadDocument' time-based metadata population (refer to 'XPathExpressions' for the corresponding XPaths for the following rules):
  1) DocumentMetadata.ServiceStartTime = [XPathExpressions.SERVICE_START_TIME|XPathExpressions.SERVICE_FIXED_TIME|XPathExpressions.CREATION_TIME]
  2) DocumentMetadata.ServiceStopTime = [XPathExpressions.SERVICE_STOP_TIME|XPathExpressions.SERVICE_FIXED_TIME|XPathExpressions.CREATION_TIME]
  The value of each time is populated from a single XPath result, from right to left, in order of precision.

0.6.1 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.
This release works against the current interfaces.

Pre-Requisites:
+ SVT 5.11 (or greater) environment required for support of:
  1) CDA document <id> root value of type UUID in document uploads.
  2) Signature verification
  3) 'GetRepresentativeList' and 'RegisterPCEHR' clients.

Change History:
* Modified 'RegisterPCEHR' sample code to provide an correct example for:
  1) registering a PCEHR with an IHI (child-specific sample code, with parent assertion details)
  2) registering a PCEHR with demographics (individual-specific code)
- Inclusion of generated code JAR files supporting the deprecation of the 'GetIndividualDetails'
  operation:
  1) nehta-vendorlibrary-java-pcehr-compiled-wsdl-2.1.0-docs.jar
  2) nehta-vendorlibrary-java-pcehr-compiled-wsdl-2.1.0-sources.jar
  3) nehta-vendorlibrary-java-pcehr-compiled-wsdl-2.1.0.jar

0.6.0 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.
This release works against the current interfaces.

Pre-Requisites:
+ SVT 5.11 (or greater) environment required for support of:
  1) CDA document <id> root value of type UUID in document uploads.
  2) Signature verification
  3) 'GetRepresentativeList' and 'RegisterPCEHR' clients.

Change History:
* Abstraction of some common client behaviour to improve manageability.
* Updated 'license.txt' with new license text for vendor library usage.
+ Added 'RegisterPCEHR' client and sample code.
+ Added 'GetRepresentativeList' client and sample code.
+ Added response signature verification to 'SecurityHandler', utilising XSP libraries. For further detail
  on the verification process, please see the '/lib/provided/nehta-smi-xsp-1.0.3*.jar' libraries.
+ Added a constructor to clients that accepts an additional 'CertificateVerifier' object
  parameter. If certificate verification is not desired, the original constructor should be used. This
  constructor now passes an empty 'CertificateVerifier' implementation parameter.
+ Added 'MinimalCertificateVerifier' implementation. This is an optional verifier that can be passed
  to client constructors. If this is not supplied, no certificate verification will occur.
+ Added 'CertificateVerifierUsageSample' to show how a 'CertificateVerifier' instance would be supplied
  to a client.

0.5 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code the PCEHR interfaces.
This release works against the current interfaces.

Known Issues:
- CDA document <id> root value must be an OID, for document uploads. Other
  operations may accept both in situations where the SVT environment contains
  valid documents with UUIDs.

Change History:
* UTC times supported for 'SubmitObjectsRequest' times. These values are extracted from the CDA root
  document and support the following formats defined in the 'DateParsePatterns' enum. Note that all
  UTC times will conform to the following format:
    YYYY[MM[DD[hh[mm[ss]]]]]
  This means that all timezones, if present will be applied in the conversion and any fractional second
  precision will be dropped from the date/time string.
+ Added 'UploadDocumentMetadataClient' support and associated 'UploadDocumentMetadataSample' code.
* 'service[Start/Stop]Time' for 'SubmitObjectRequests' are now derived from the CDA root document,
  if present at the following locations:
    serviceStartTime = '/ClinicalDocument/componentOf/encompassingEncounter/effectiveTime/low/@value'
    serviceStopTime = '/ClinicalDocument/componentOf/encompassingEncounter/effectiveTime/high/@value'

0.4 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code the PCEHR interfaces.
This release works against the current interfaces.

Known Issues:
- CDA document <id> root value must be an OID, for document uploads. Other
  operations may accept both in situations where the SVT environment contains
  valid documents with UUIDs.
- UploadDocumentMetadata operations are not supported in this release.

Change History:
* Updated template FormatCodes to reflect the current values supported in
  the SVT environment.
+ Added a helper class 'DocumentUtils' which provides a method to update the ID
  in a CDA document, in memory. This is useful when testing multiple document
  uploads as it bypasses the need to manually edit the XML file by hand.
+ Added an additional method for the 'UploadDocumentClient' to allow a document
  to be replaced.

0.3 (DRAFT)
------------------
This is a draft release of sample code the PCEHR interfaces.
This release works against the current interfaces.

Known Issues:
- CDA documents <id> root value must be an OID.
- UploadDocumentMetadata operations are not supported in this release.

Change History:
* Updated Template FormatCodes ID values to match current test IDs.
+ Included additional enum entries for Template FormatCodes. This set
  provides the final template ID values to be used once the test environment
  is transitioned to these.
* Fixed bug in date conversion for GetAuditView client.
* GetDocumentClient's use of MTOM permantently set. Constructor param
  to allow configuration of this setting has been removed.
* UploadDocumentClient's use of MTOM permantently set. Constructor param
  to allow configuration of this setting has been removed.
* Fixed build issue where xmlsec-<version>.jar was not being included amongst
  provided libraries, causing sample code runtime failures.
